0x01. Caching

Background Context
In this project, you learn different caching algorithms.

Resources
Read or watch:

Cache replacement policies - FIFO
Cache replacement policies - LIFO
Cache replacement policies - LRU
Cache replacement policies - MRU
Cache replacement policies - LFU
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What a caching system is
What FIFO means
What LIFO means
What LRU means
What MRU means
What LFU means
What the purpose of a caching system
What limits a caching system have
Requirements
Python Scripts
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
